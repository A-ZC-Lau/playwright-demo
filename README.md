# intro

My demo at using Playwright. Using Seek as it has a relatively simple API to intercept and mock.

# install

npm install
npx playwright install

# run

Unit test

`npm run test-unit search.spec.ts`

# results/aftermath

Artifacts are located in `test-results` trace files and videos are always saved to double check that the tests are performing as expected

run `npm run show-report` in order to see trace file (when successful)
